\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
This software is made to help provide an efficient methods for students and administration to book auditoriums for various events. It is build to add new events as per availability of the Auditorium, and edit events which are already present. The software is flexible and can be extended for various types of seats and other functionalities. It is a software that can be deployed in schools and colleges to reduce errors often caused due to physical selling of tickets. One could book a ticket directly from any place as the software can be hosted on a web server. An user of the software can book seats , cancel already booked seats for an event and get printed ticket for booking and cancellation. User can check number of available and book seats for an event. User can create new authorized sales person’s and clerk’s log in accounts. It also records all the transactions and prepares balance sheets for each event and also for the entire year. The manager can create new authorized sales person’s and clerk’s log in accounts.


\section{Product Functions}

The software is intended for the use of four types of users - show manager,accounts clerk,sales persons and customers(spectators). The functions for each type of user provided by this software are listed as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Show Manager}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add New Show: The SM can add a new show with a date,timings based on the availability of the auditorium. Fixing a particular number of shows on a date and fixing the number and price of the balcony and ordinary seats for sale in a particular show are exclusive rights of SM. Offering seats as complimentary gifts to the students' society and VIPs are also handled by the SM.

		\item Manage Account for SP and AC: The SM is able to create new account for authorised SP and AC and will be able to change passwords for the all SP and AC.
		
		\item Query: The SM can query the percentage of seats booked of each type and also the amount collected for each show
		
		\item Check Balance Sheet: The SM can access different types of balance sheets(based on a show or annual sheet) for the auditorium.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item \textbf{Accounts Clerk}
	\begin{enumerate}
	
		\item Add Expenditure: The AC can add expenditures for a show with a description for the expense. 
		
	\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Sales Person}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Book Ticket: SP will be able to book and authorise tickets for a customer and make a sale for the show.
	\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Customer}
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Cancel Tickets: The Customer will be able to cancel their tickets before the starting of the show.
		
		\item Query for Seats: The Customer will be able to check the availability of different classes of seats.
		
	\end{enumerate}
 
 
\end{enumerate}


\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
We have used following classes in our software :
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show: Show is a class to handle shows hosted by auditorium. It stores show ID, show date and time, seats list and price of different types of seats.
	\item Ticket: Ticket holds information about which show it is for, the type of seat booked, total price and the userId.
	\item Transaction: It is a class to store information about flow of money, it stores the details about a transaction of money.It stores the reason for transaction, amount, date and time. It also stores the Id of user involved in the transaction.
	\item Expenditure: A show has various expenditures incurred including payment of artists.
	\item User: A user has his personal details like UserId, Name, email,etc.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Operating Environment}

We are testing this to work on the following tech stack- JDK11 and above, MongoDB 4.4 and above, Apache Maven 3.6 and above and node 14.5 and above. We have tested it to run on reasonably recent modern browser like Google Chrome 88 and above, firefox 86 and above with amd64 architecture.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Total number of seats in the auditorium must be fixed at any time.
	
	\item  Total number of seats booked by a customer can not exceed a beyond a considerable logical value.
	
	\item SM can not be fired. In other words, there must be a SM present in the auditorium to manage the system.
	
	\item Tickets can not be sold by spectators or transferred to others.
	
\end{enumerate}


\section{User Documentation}

The front-end of the software will be kept sufficiently intuitive and straight forward for an internet literate person to use.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

We have assumed the following: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Computers are available to all types of users and users are computer literate and internet literate.
	
	\item Only one SM is present at a time. 
	
\end{itemize}

Our dependencies are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The software is being developed in Linux operating system.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
The user-interface is a browser-based GUI. It begins with a \emph{login page}, where the user logs in with his/her username and password. He is then taken to the correct dashboard, depending on the type of user he/she is. The customer can also sign-up from the \emph{sign-up page}.

\subsection{Manager Dashboard}
From the Manager dashboard, SM can access the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create Show.
\item Create Accounts Clerk login.
\item Create Salesperson login.
\item View Shows. In each show, the SM can do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item View Show sales statistics
\item View Show balance sheet
\end{itemize}
\item View Accounts clerks. For each accounts clerk, the SM can:
\begin{itemize}
\item View accountant info
\item Delete accountant login
\end{itemize}
\item View Salespersons. For each salesperson, the SM can:
\begin{itemize}
\item View Salesperson info
\item View the transactions he/she has made and the commission payable there-of
\end{itemize}
\item View the annual balance-sheet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer dashboard}
From the customer dashboard, customer can:
\begin{itemize}
\item View shows, in terms of timing and ticket availability
\item View tickets booked - can also cancel them
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Salesperson dashboard}
The salesman dashboard serves to book tickets for existing customers

\subsection{Accounts Clerk dashboard}
The accounts clerk dashboard serves to add expenditures for a show

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
SAMS consists of two components - a back-end API server, which communicates with the database, and the front-end server, which can be accessed from a browser. These two components need not run on the same computer, and can be even on two separate domains. For interests of time, in the version being delivered, we will be running both components on the same computer on localhost. The back end will be running on an Apache Tomcat server, while the front-end will be running on Serve.

\section{Software Interfaces}

This section describes the API that the bookend exposes. The API is listed in Table \ref{table:api}. Note that the endpoint is the tail of the URL after the base address. Eg: If the end-point is \texttt{/users}, and the base URL is \texttt{http://localhost:8080}, then the actual URL for this end-point is \url{http://localhost:8080/users}.
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{SAMS API}
	\label{table:api}
	\smallskip
	\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\begin{tabular}{cll}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Method} & \textbf{End-point} & \textbf{Function} \\
		\midrule
		GET & \texttt{/shows} & Returns all shows \\
		POST & \texttt{/shows} & Create a show \\
		GET & \texttt{/shows/\{id\}} & Get one show \\
		\midrule
		GET & \texttt{/tickets} & Return all tickets \\
		POST & \texttt{/tickets} & Create (sell) a ticket \\
		GET & \texttt{/tickets/\{id\}} & Get a particular ticket \\
		DELETE & \texttt{/tickets/\{id\}} & Cancel a ticket \\
		GET & \texttt{/tickets/by\_show/\{id\}} & Get tickets sold of a particular show \\

		GET & \texttt{/transactions/by\_salesperson/\{id\}} & Get all transactions done by that salesperson\\
		GET & \texttt{/transactions/by\_year/\{yyyy\}} & Get all transactions made in that year \\
		\midrule
		GET & \texttt{/expenditures} & Get all expenditures \\
		POST & \texttt{/expenditures} & Create a expenditure \\
		GET & \texttt{/expenditures/\{id\}} & Get an expenditure \\
		GET & \texttt{/expenditures/by\_show/\{id\}} & Get all expenditures of a show \\
		\midrule
		GET & \texttt{/users/login} & Validate username and password \\
		GET & \texttt{/users} & Get all users \\
		POST & \texttt{/users} & Create a user account \\
		GET & \texttt{/users/\{id\}} & Get one user \\
		DELETE & \texttt{/users/\{id\}} & Delete a user account \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\section{Communications Interfaces}
The back-end API is to be accessed via the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol). It is to be noted that in the version of SAMS being delivered, TLS (Transport Layer Security) will \emph{not} be used. As a consequence, the API traffic will not be encrypted and it is desirable that the back-end API server and the front-end web-app server run on the same machine and communicate over \texttt{localhost}.
