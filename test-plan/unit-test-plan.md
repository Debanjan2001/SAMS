# Unit Test Plan for SAMS

This document contains the test plan for unit testing the backend of SAMS (which runs on Spring Boot). We would be using JUnit5 and Spring Boot Test Runner for writing the unit tests. The unit tests are organized by the data models and test all the public functions of the Service Layer.

## User

### Create user

Tests the `createUser` function.

Successful creation:

- Create a User object.
- Save it using `createUser`.
- The returned `Optional` must **not** be empty.
- The returned User is extracted. It must match with original user on `getUsername`, `getPassword` and `getType`.
