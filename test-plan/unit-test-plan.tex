\section{Unit Test Plan for SAMS}\label{unit-test-plan-for-sams}}

This document contains the test plan for unit testing the backend of
SAMS (which runs on Spring Boot). We would be using JUnit5 and Spring
Boot Test Runner for writing the unit tests. The unit tests are
organized by the data models and test all the public functions of the
Service Layer. To isolate the service layer, the database layer is
mocked by Mockito. Assert4J is used to improve readability of
assertions.
